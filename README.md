🔭 **About Me**

Hi there! I'm a passionate Web and Software Developer with a keen interest in bridging the gap between technology and creativity. My journey in tech is fueled by my love for music and astrophysics, and my unique experience of synesthesia, which colors my approach to coding and problem-solving.

🌐 **Web & Software Development**

As a developer, I specialize in creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My technical toolkit includes:

    Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
    Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
    Databases: MongoDB, SQL
    Tools: Git, Docker, AWS

🚀 **Continuous Learning & Growth**

I believe in lifelong learning and constantly seek to update my skills. Currently, I'm delving deeper into advanced JavaScript frameworks and exploring cloud computing to broaden my development capabilities.

🌌 **A Blend of Science and Art**

My fascination with astrophysics and my synesthetic experience with music don't just define my hobbies but also influence how I perceive coding. To me, each line of code is like a note in a symphony, contributing to the larger picture of creating harmonious and efficient software solutions.


💡 **Open to Collaborate**

I'm always open to collaboration and knowledge sharing. Whether it's a web development project, a software challenge, or discussing the latest in space science and music, feel free to reach out!


📚 **Forever a Student**

Apart from coding, I spend my time reading about the latest developments in astrophysics, experimenting with new music genres, and continuously seeking ways to intertwine my diverse interests into my professional work.
